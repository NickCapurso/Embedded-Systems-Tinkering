# Embedded Systems Tinkering
Collections of small programs and scripts that I've written or used to teach embedded systems concepts to undergraduate students. 

Currently includes:
* [BeagleBoneBlack Scripts](https://github.com/NickCapurso/Embedded-Systems-Tinkering/blob/master/BeagleBoneBlack-Scripts) - Simple serial communication and I2C on the BBB.
* [Arduino Sensor Headers](https://github.com/NickCapurso/Embedded-Systems-Tinkering/blob/master/Arduino-Sensor-Headers) - Sample sketches for various I2C sensors I've used, compiled into header files.
* [Android Things](https://github.com/NickCapurso/Embedded-Systems-Tinkering/tree/master/AndroidThings) - Sample programs to run on an [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/index.html) platform.
