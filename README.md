# Arduino Sensor Headers
A collection of different header files and their implementations for I2C communication with various sensors, which I have used to help teach students I2C with the Arduino. 

*Many have drawn from sample sketches online* (cited in opening comment blocks), but have been modified to be put into a header format and also by my experiences in wiring them up. Also includes a few standalone Arduino sketches for testing the sensors and printing their values to the serial console.
